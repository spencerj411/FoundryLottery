# FoundryLottery
A decentralised automated lottery system enabled by smart contracts and Chainlink VRF's and Automation.
I am creating this project to practice my knowledge and skills in blockchain, smart contract development with Foundry, and implementing Chainlink's VRF and Automation.
I am implementhing this project myself, with my own code, guided by the [Cyfrin Updraft's smart contract development course](https://github.com/Cyfrin/foundry-full-course-cu).
